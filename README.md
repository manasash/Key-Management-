# Key-Management-Wireless sensor networks consists of a set of extremely light sensor nodes with limited  resources.

KEY MANAGEMENT IN WSN : Key management refers to management of cryptographic keys in a cryptosystem. 

It is a set of processes and mechanisms which support key formation and allows keying among valid nodes based on a security policy and guarantees security in the services and applications of the WSN.

Key management includes key generation , key storage , retrieval and managing of keys.

Key Pre-distribution is a scheme to distribute keys onto different sensor nodes prior to deployment.
